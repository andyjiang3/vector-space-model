Don't go through your camera roll
So much you don't know
That you've forgotten
What a trip
The way you can flip
Through all the good parts of it
I shouldn't have done it
Chronological order
And nothing but torture
Scroll too far back
That's what you get
I don't wanna see 'em
But I can't delete 'em
It just doesn't feel right yet
Not yet
All the best, that's all that's left
Cruel evidence
It does me no favors
I should know
It's a place not to go
When I'm alone
I'll just feel bad later
Chronological order
And nothing but torture
Scroll too far back
That's what you get
I don't wanna see 'em
But I can't delete 'em
It just doesn't feel right yet
Not yet
Look at me, I'm living all alone
And now you're only living in my phone
Anyway, thanks
For all the nights and the days
And everything that you gave
I'll never erase it
There's one where we look so in love
Before we lost all the sun
And I made you take it
